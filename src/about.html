                     <p>The vision of Hogwarts School for Palestinians is to build strong, positive connections with students so they can achieve independence, confidence, and academic knowledge.Bowman believes in providing students with alternative opportunities to learn, grow, and attain success. Bowman believes in a trusting, caring environment where diversity is honored and respected. Our students learn in a variety of ways and are viewed as individuals evolving into their own identities. Positive relationships are the core of Bowmanâ€™s success. We believe growth occurs when individuals feel safe, respected, and appreciated. Bowman creates a culture that values people and connections, making it a unique, accepting, academic environment for students to succeed on many levels. The legacy of Bowman is to prepare students to move forward with a strong sense of self into a life filled with promise.</p>
