The Dean's List specifically includes those students whose G.P.A. for the semester was 85 or better while registered for twelve or more semester hours of the course work. A grade of “F” or “IC” in any course makes the student ineligible for the Dean's Honor List regardless of other grades.</p>

                     <p>Life at Hogwarts revolves around classes, naturally. However, as the castle is also the students’ home for most of the year, daily life consists of far more than just academics. The students arrive at Hogwarts on September 1 by Hogwarts Express. For the next nine or ten months they eat, sleep, study, play, fight, argue, love, and celebrate just like kids anywhere in the world. Romances blossom, rivalries flair up, clubs form, and competitions are won and lost. At the end of the year, the students take exams and the house which has accumulated the most points over the course of those months wins the House Cup. Then sometime in the month of June they travel home on the Hogwarts Express, back to their waiting parents at King’s Cross.</p>

                     <p>Our teams claimed four medals out of 13 in the latest unofficial ACM-ICPC international programming contest, including two gold-tier victories.
                        The ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) is one of the biggest competitions for students learning computer programming. To win, teams of three people have only several hours to code programs to correctly solve several computing problems. The team with the most problems solved in the shortest time possible wins. The rules don’t allow students with too many years of higher education or those who took part in five regional or two world finals in previous years.
                        This year’s world finale was hosted by Peking University in the Chinese capital. The local team won one of the four gold medals, beating a team from the University of Tokyo by virtue of a better time. But two Russian teams – one from the Moscow State University and one from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology – were even better. The MSU team took more time, but managed to solve nine problems out of 11 and win the place in the ICPC for the very first time in the university’s two-decade competition record. The MIPT students took less time to solve eight problems, the same number as fellow contestants from China and Japan. The results were also a personal best for the institute.
